#Script: Plot4.R
#Purpose: Read the National Emissions Inventory Database and answer the question below:
#         Question: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related
#                   sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
##
##Assumption: If the SCC.Level.One contains the word "comb" and SCC.Level.Four contains "coal", then it is a coal combustion related source

#Load the required R libraries 
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#Set working directory

#Read the data for National Emissions Inventory Database into dataframe- NEI with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008
NEI <- readRDS(paste(getwd(),"/Data/NEI_data/summarySCC_PM25.rds",sep=""))
#Read the data from Source Classification Code Table containing mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name and details of the PM2.5 source
SCC <- readRDS(paste(getwd(),"/Data/NEI_data/Source_Classification_Code.rds",sep=""))

#Filter out the coal combustion related sources from Source Classification code dataset- SCC. Assumption is if the SCC.Level.One contains the word "comb" and SCC.Level.Four contains "coal", then it is a coal combustion related source
CoalSources <- filter(SCC,grepl("comb", SCC$SCC.Level.One, ignore.case=TRUE) & grepl("coal", SCC$SCC.Level.Four, ignore.case=TRUE))

#Create dataset with only the required elements from NEI dataset. Remove any NAs in the year or Emissions column and rename column 'type' to 'Source' for easier readability

  select(SCC, Emissions, year, type) %>% #Select only the required columns

#Retrieve emission data for only coal combustion related sources based on joining the datasets- CoalSources, NEI_emission_source
CoalEmission <- merge(x = CoalSources, y=NEI_emission_source, all.x=FALSE)

#Group the emission data by year to get enable summarization of the emissions from coal combustion related sources at year level
GroupByYear <- group_by(CoalEmission, year)
TotalEmissionPerYear <-summarize(GroupByYear, totalEmissions = sum(Emissions))

#Add a label 'All coal-combustion sources' to the total emission data summarized at year level for all sources
TotalEmissionPerYear <- mutate(TotalEmissionPerYear, EI.Sector = "All coal-combustion sources")

#Group the emission data by year and source to get enable summarization of the emissions data at year and source level (identified by EI.Sector column in the dataset)
GroupByYearBySource <- group_by(CoalEmission, year, EI.Sector)
TotalEmissionPerYearPerSource <- summarize(GroupByYearBySource, totalEmissions = sum(Emissions))

#Merge the dataset- TotalEmissionPerYear and TotalEmissionPerYearPerSource to get the summarized Total Emission information for all sources combined and at individual source level (identified by EI.Sector column in the dataset)
TotalEmission <- merge(x=TotalEmissionPerYear, y=TotalEmissionPerYearPerSource, all=TRUE)

#Use ggplot2 graphing system to show total emissions from coal combustion related sources across 1999 to 2008 in U.S.
g<-ggplot(TotalEmission, aes(clarity, x = year, y = totalEmissions, color = EI.Sector, label=totalEmissions))
